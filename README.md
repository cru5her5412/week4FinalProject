What requirements did you achieve?

- all required, and a few stretch goals

Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- UI and UX are something i need to improve at. i also would like to learn more about the inbetween workings to be able to debug easier
